  EcoSip - Smart Bottle Website

  Project Description

This repository contains the source code for the EcoSip website, a static 8-page web application designed for a fictional smart water bottle company. The project demonstrates proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3 without the use of external frameworks (like Bootstrap) or JavaScript libraries, adhering strictly to the academic guidelines provided for Capstone Project 1-A.

The website showcases the "EcoSip" product, featuring technical specifications, a companion app preview, customer reviews, and a responsive navigation system.

   Features

  * 8-Page Structure: A fully navigable site including Home, Product, Features, App, Reviews, FAQ, About Us, and Enquiry pages.
  * Sticky Navigation Bar: A fixed header that remains accessible while scrolling.
  * Responsive Design: Utilizes CSS Flexbox and percentage-based padding to adapt to different screen sizes.
  * CSS Gradients: Implements a modern `linear-gradient` background with a fixed attachment for a premium aesthetic.
  * Static Forms: Includes a styled Enquiry form and contact section.
  * Semantic HTML: Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` tags.
